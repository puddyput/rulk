# rulk

This is just another rotary phone conversion project based on python 3.
I'll fill in more details as I go, this is the basics:

- based on siemens analog phone with rotary dial
- using twinkle as cli voip client
- python based input handler that sends commands to twinkle process
- hardware hacks for wireless usage will follow
